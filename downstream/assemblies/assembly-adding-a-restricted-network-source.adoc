= Adding a restricted network source

You can install OpenShift Container Platform on a restricted network that does not have access to the internet.

When operating on a restricted network, the cost report CSV files are stored locally using a persistent volume claim (PVC), and must be uploaded manually to link:https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com].
