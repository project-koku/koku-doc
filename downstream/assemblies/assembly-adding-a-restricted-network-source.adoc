= Adding a restricted network source

You can install OpenShift Container Platform on a restricted network that does not have access to the internet.

The procedure to add an OpenShift Container Platform cluster operating on a restricted network as a cost management source is different in the following ways:

. Operator Lifecycle Manager is configured to install and run local sources.
. The `koku-metrics-operator` is configured to store cost report CSV files locally using a persistent volume claim (PVC).
. Cost reports stored in the PVC are downloaded to a workstation.
. An OpenShift Container Platform source is created manually.
. Cost reports are uploaded to link:https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com] from your workstation.
