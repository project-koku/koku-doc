// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging.adoc
// * ID: [id="assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging"]
// * Title: = Managing cost data using tagging

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules_{context}"].
= Managing cost data using tagging
:context: tagging
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

This guide explains in depth how tagging works in cost management, and how you can use tagging to best organize and view your resources to manage your costs.

= Configuring tags and labels in cost management

You must configure tags in each source before cost management can use the tags to automatically organize your cost data. 

After adding your sources to cost management:

. Tag or label resources on each of your sources. See xref:assembly_configuring_tags_sources[].
. (Optional) Enable OpenShift tag grouping to further organize your cost data views for each source. See xref:enabling_tag_grouping_OCP[].
. Refine and add to your tags to optimize your view of cost data. See xref:con_planning_tagging_strategy[].
