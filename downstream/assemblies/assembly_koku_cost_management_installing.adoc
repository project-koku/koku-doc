//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
To support cost management in Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.5 and more recent versions, a new community operator is introduced, `koku-metrics-operator`.

The community `cost-mgt-operator` supported in OCP 4.3 and OCP 4.4 is deprecated. Though this cost operator functions with cost management in OCP 4.5, it is no longer supported.

To avoid gaps in your cost management data, you can wait 24 to 48 hours before removing `cost-mgt-operator` while you verify that `koku-metrics-operator` provides cost management reports.
