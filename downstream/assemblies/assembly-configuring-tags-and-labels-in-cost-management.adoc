= Configuring tags and labels in cost management
:context: configuring-tags-and-labels

[role="_abstract"]
You must configure tags in each source before cost management can use the tags to automatically organize your cost data.

After adding your sources to cost management:

. Tag or label resources on each of your sources. See xref:assembly-configuring-tags-sources_configuring-tags-and-labels[].
. (Optional) Enable OpenShift tag grouping to further organize your cost data views for each source. See xref:enabling-tag-grouping-OCP_configuring-tags-sources[].
. Refine and add to your tags to optimize your view of cost data. See xref:planning-tagging-strategy_planning-your-tagging-strategy[].
