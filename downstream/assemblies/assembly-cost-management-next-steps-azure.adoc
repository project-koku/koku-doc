= Next steps for managing your costs
:context: next-steps-azure

[role="_abstract"]
After adding your {openshift} and Microsoft Azure sources, in addition to showing cost data by source, {product-title} will automatically show Azure cost and usage related to running your OpenShift Container Platform clusters on their platform.

On the {product-title} *Overview* page ({link-cost-management}), your cost data will be sorted into *OpenShift* and *Infrastructure* tabs. From here, you can use *Perspective* to select different views of your cost data.

You can also use the left navigation menu to view the additional details of your costs by service.
