ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly_organizing_cost_data_using_tags.adoc
// * ID: [id="assembly_organizing_cost_data_using_tags.adoc"]
// * Title: = Organizing cost data using tags

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="a-collection-of-modules"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules_{context}"].
= Organizing cost data using tags
//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
:context: assembly-keyword
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

After adding your AWS and OpenShift Container Platform sources, in addition to showing cost data by source, cost management will automatically show AWS cost and usage related to running your OpenShift Container Platform clusters on AWS. 

The cost management application tracks these costs using tags (called labels in OpenShift), which you can refine to filter and attribute to resources. Tags in cost management allow you to organize your resources by cost and to allocate the costs to different parts of your cloud infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tags and labels can only be configured directly on a source. You cannot edit tags and labels in the cost management application.

include::../modules/con_how_cost_associates_tags_between_sources.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// [leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module starts with a level-1 heading (= Heading), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading (== Heading) in the assembly.

include::../modules/proc_adding_tags_to_an_AWS_resource.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::../modules/proc_adding_tags_to_an_OCP_resource.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Next steps

* Refine your tags and tagging strategy to better organize your view of cost data. See the _Managing cost data using tagging_ guide for more details.
