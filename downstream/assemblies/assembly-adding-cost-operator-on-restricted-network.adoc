= Adding a cost operator on a restricted network

In OpenShift Container Platform, you can perform a restricted network installation that does not have access to the internet.

When operating on a restricted network, the cost report CSV files are stored locally using a Persistent Volume Claim, and must be uploaded manually to  https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com].

This guide describes the process that is required to install and configure the Koku metrics operator on a restricted network.
