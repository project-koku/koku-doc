= Installing a metrics operator on a restricted network

For OpenShift Container Platform clusters that are installed on restricted networks, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) by default cannot access the koku-metrics-operator hosted remotely on Quay.io because those remote sources require full Internet connectivity. Therefore, OLM must be configured to install and run local sources.
