= Add sources to {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
A source is a provider account that is connected to {product-title} to be monitored, for example, an OpenShift Container Platform deployment, or a cloud infrastructure provider. To use {product-title} to monitor your cloud costs, you must first connect a data source to the {product-title} application.

Currently, {product-title} can track costs for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform sources.

From {link-sources}, you can view, edit, and delete sources connected to {product-title}.

For more information on how to add sources to {product-title}, follow these guides:
