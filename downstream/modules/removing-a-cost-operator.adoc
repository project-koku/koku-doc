= Removing a prior cost operator

[role="_abstract"]
After installing the `koku-metrics-operator`, uninstall the prior `cost-mgmt-operator` operator.

To avoid gaps in your cost management data, you can wait 24 to 48 hours before removing `cost-mgmt-operator` while you verify that `koku-metrics-operator` provides cost management reports.

NOTE: If you mistakenly remove the *Koku Metrics Operator*, reinstall it.

.Prerequisites
* The `cost-mgmt-operator` is installed.
+
NOTE: The `cost-mgmt-operator` is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4.5 and later. Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.5 or later, you must install `koku-metrics-operator`.

* You installed the *Koku Metrics Operator*.
* You are logged into the OpenShift Container Platform web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* You can view the operators in the *Installed Operators* tab.

.Procedure
. In the Installed Operators list, select the operator you want to remove.
. Click on the image:more-options.png[] (More options) icon in that row.
. Click on the *Uninstall Operator* option. Confirm the action to remove the operator.
. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click the *Administration > Custom Resource Definitions* tab.
. In the window that displays the custom resource definitions (CRD), locate the *CostManagement* CRD and the *CostManagementData* CRD.
. For each CRD, click on the image:more-options.png[] (More options) icon and click on *Delete Custom Resource Definition*. Confirm the delete action.
. When these CRDs are deleted, the `cost-mgmt-operator` is fully uninstalled.

NOTE: When you install *Koku Metrics Operator*, a *KokuMetricsConfig* CRD appears in  *Administration > Custom Resource Definitions* list.
