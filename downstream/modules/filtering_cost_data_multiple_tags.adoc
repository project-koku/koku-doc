= Filtering cost data by multiple tags

You can use multiple tag filters simultaneously to create a view of cost data that is specific to your needs. You also may want to filter by one dimension, while grouping by another dimension.

This is useful for finding the root cause of a cost or problem, or investigating part of the environment that acts independently of the rest, such as a cost center or an specific environment. 

Filtering allows you to hide information about the rest of the environment to help avoid unneeded complexity in cost data results and allow you to find the desired information, which can otherwise be hidden among other data.

This example shows how an educational course provider who is running a lab environment on OpenShift Container Platform can use multiple filters to view cost information broken down by student and course.

.Prerequisites

* Your OpenShift cluster added as a cost management data source. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html/getting_started_with_cost_management/assembly_adding_sources_cost#assembly_adding_ocp_sources[Adding an OpenShift Container Platform source to cost management] in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions.
* Your cloud infrastructure account added as a cost management data source. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html/getting_started_with_cost_management/assembly_adding_sources_cost[Adding sources to cost management] in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions for your cloud provider type.
* Configure tags on your sources. For tips and configuration instructions, see LINK.

.Procedure

. From the *OpenShift details* page in the *Group cost by:* field, select the tag key to group the cost by. In this case, select _Tag Key:user_ to show results grouped by student user. 
. In the filter area, select *Tag*.
. In the *Choose key* list, select the tag key _user_.
. In the *Choose value* dropdown list, check the values _course_id_ and _course_type_ to identify how many students have taken the course X and the costs for that course.
//course_id=XYZ and course_type=ILT
