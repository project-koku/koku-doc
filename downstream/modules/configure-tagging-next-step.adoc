= Configure tagging for your sources


[role="_abstract"]
The {product-title} application tracks cloud and infrastructure costs using tags (called labels in OpenShift), which you can refine to filter and attribute to resources. Tags in {product-title} allow you to organize your resources by cost and to allocate the costs to different parts of your cloud infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tags and labels can only be configured directly on a source. You cannot edit tags and labels in the {product-title} application.
