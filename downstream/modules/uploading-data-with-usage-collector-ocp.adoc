== Uploading data with Usage Collector

// The URL for this procedure needs to go in the UI code in the Sources dialog.

The Usage Collector retrieves usage data from the Operator Metering endpoint and compresses it into a package (an OpenShift Container Platform metrics report) that is uploaded for processing by {product-title} via the Red Hat Insights Client. Data collection is performed via the _ocp_usage.sh_ script.

Create a cron job to regularly upload data collected by the Usage Collector to {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cron user requires:

* access to the file with metering-operator token
* sudo access to interact with the Red Hat Insights client.
====

. To configure sudo access, add the following to the _/etc/sudoers_ file, substituting _ocpcollector_  with the cron user:
+
----
ocpcollector    ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL
----
+
. Open the crontab for the user that will execute the scheduled upload:
+
----
# crontab -u <username> -e
----
+
. Create a crontab entry to run the Usage Collector every 45 minutes:
+
----
*/45 * * * * /path/to/ocp_usage.sh --collect --e OCP_CLUSTER_ID=<YOUR_OCP_IDENTIFIER>
----
+
. In the {platform-title} *Sources* wizard, click *Next* to move to the confirmation screen.
. In the {platform-title} *Sources* wizard, review the details and click *Finish* to finish adding the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
