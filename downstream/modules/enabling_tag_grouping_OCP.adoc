= Enabling OpenShift tag grouping

By default, cost management groups OpenShift cost data by cluster, node, and project on the *OpenShift details* page. Grouping data by tag key can be useful to further customize your view.

To group your cost data by tag key, you must enable the tag keys in the cloud.redhat.com application settings.

.Prerequisites

* You must have Organization Administrator privileges to change these settings in cost management. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.5/html-single/getting_started_with_cost_management/index#assembly_cost_limiting_access_rbac[Limiting access to cost management resources] in _Getting started with cost management_ for more information about user roles and access.

.Procedure
//Updated July 20, 2020 to match current Applications tab in Settings

. Click image:configuration-gear.png[] (*Settings*) to navigate to *Applications* > *Cost management*.
. Click *Enable OpenShift labels*.
. Select the keys you want to group by in the cost management application from the *Available Tags* list, and use the arrows to move the tags to the *Enabled Tags* list.
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

.Verification steps

The enabled tag keys will now be available to group costs by from the *OpenShift details* area of cost management, in the *View by* list. For example, when you choose *View by: Tag*:
