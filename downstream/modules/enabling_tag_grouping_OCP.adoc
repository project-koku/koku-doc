// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: enabling_tag_grouping_OCP.adoc
// * ID: [id="enabling_tag_grouping_OCP"]
// * Title: = Enabling OpenShift tag grouping

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

= Enabling OpenShift tag grouping

By default, cost management groups OpenShift cost data by cluster, node, and project on the *OpenShift details* page. Grouping data by tag key can be useful to further customize your view.

To group your cost data by tag key, you must enable the tag keys in the cloud.redhat.com application settings. 

.Prerequisites

* You must have Organization Administrator privileges to change these settings in cost management. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html-single/getting_started_with_cost_management/index#assembly_cost_limiting_access_rbac[Limiting access to cost management resources] in _Getting started with cost management_ for more information about user roles and access.

.Procedure

To enable OpenShift tag keys for grouping:

. Click image:configuration-gear.png[] (*Settings*) to navigate to *Applications* > *Cost management*.
. Click *OpenShift Tag Management*.
. Select the keys you want to group by in the cost management application from the *Available Tag Keys* list, and use the arrows to move the tags to the *Enabled Tag Keys* list. 
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

.Verification steps

The enabled tag keys will now be available to group costs by from the *OpenShift details* area of cost management, in the *Group cost by* list. For example:
