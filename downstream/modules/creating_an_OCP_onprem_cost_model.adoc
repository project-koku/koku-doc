= Creating a cost model for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster

As metrics and inventory from OpenShift Container Platform sources do not have costs associated, you must create a cost model to associate a price to resources.

This example shows an OpenShift cluster running on-premises, meaning that while your cluster is running on cloud infrastructure (for example, AWS or Azure) you are not managing the infrastructure yourself. The cloud infrastructure costs are seen in cost management as part of the cluster cost, so creating a cost model allows you to distribute the underlying infrastructure cost to OpenShift.

Creating a cost model for an OpenShift source includes assigning prices for usage and requests, and applying a markup or discount to determine the total costs of your OpenShift infrastructure.

You can assign your desired rates to *CPU*, *Memory*, *Node*, *Cluster*, or *Storage* metrics. You can set one rate per metric.

This example shows how to design and apply a cost model to your OpenShift on-premises cluster to accurately reflect the costs of running the cluster, including:

* How to account for monthly OpenShift cluster and node costs
* How to assign rates to OpenShift metrics and usage
* How to classify costs as _infrastructure_ or _supplementary_
* How to apply a _markup_ against your _raw cost_ to get the _usage cost_

.Prerequisites

* A user with Cost Administrator or Cost Price List Administrator permissions. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.4/html/getting_started_with_cost_management/assembly_cost_limiting_access_rbac[Limiting access to cost management resources] for instructions on configuring user roles.
* Your OpenShift cluster added as a cost management data source. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.4/html/getting_started_with_cost_management/assembly_adding_sources_cost#assembly_adding_ocp_sources[Adding an OpenShift Container Platform source to cost management] in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions.

.Procedure

. From the *Cost models* menu, click *Create cost model* to open the cost model wizard.
. Enter a name and description for the cost model, and select *OpenShift Container Platform* as the source type to apply the cost model to. Click *Next*.
. Create a price list so you can assign rates to usage or requests. Cost management collects these metrics from OpenShift but there is no cost attached to them in cost management until you apply a cost model. You can also create your price list later.
.. To apply a monthly node cost of $1,000:
... Click *Add rate*.
... For *Metric*, select *Node*.
... For *Measurement*, select *Price (node-month)*.
... In the *Rate* field, enter _1000_ to assign a $1,000 per  price to each node in the sources you select (in a later step).
... Cost management classifies node and cluster costs as _infrastructure costs_ by default. To change the cost type you are calculating, use the toggle under *Rate*. See xref:cost-layers[] to learn more. 
... Click *Add rate* to save the node rate.
.. To apply a rate to CPU requests:
... For *Metric*, select *CPU*.
... For *Measurement*, select *Request (core-hours)*.
... In the *Rate* field, enter _0.09_ to apply a $0.09 cost to each core-hour of CPU requests.
... Cost management classifies metrics-based data such as CPU requests as _supplementary costs_ by default. To change the cost type you are calculating, use the toggle under *Rate*. See xref:cost-layers[] to learn more.
... Click *Add rate* to save the CPU request rate.
.. Add additional rates by repeating the previous steps, or click *Next* to finish configuring your price list.
. If desired, set a markup or discount. To apply a 10% markup to the base costs of your resources, enter _10_ in the as the *Markup rate* and click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
====
* To apply a discount rather than a markup, enter a minus sign with the value (for example, _-15_). 
* If you do not want to apply a markup or discount, enter _0_.
====  
+
. Select one or multiple OpenShift sources to assign the cost model to and click *Next*. Selecting a source with a cost model already assigned will override its previous cost model. You can also assign sources to your cost model later.
. Review the cost model details, and click *Create*.
. Click *Close* to exit the cost model wizard.

Your new cost model will appear in the list on the *Cost models* page. 

.Next steps

* From the *Cost models* summary page, you can review information about your cost models, including:
** The source type the cost model was created for 
** The number of sources assigned to the cost model
** The date the cost model was last modified
+
* To see more information or edit a cost model: 
+
** From the *Cost models* summary page, click image:more-options.png[] (*more options*), then *View details* or *Delete* the cost model. From the *View details* option, you can edit the cost model, including source assignments, markup, and other settings.

* Review your tags and tagging strategy to ensure that costs are being distributed to the correct resources, cost centers, or teams. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.4/html-single/managing_cost_data_using_tagging/index[_Using tagging to manage cost data_] for more information.
