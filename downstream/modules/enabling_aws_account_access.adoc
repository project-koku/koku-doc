== Enabling minimal account access for cost and usage consumption

// Add docs URL to UI.

To provide data within the web interface and API, cost management needs to consume the Cost and Usage Reports produced by AWS. For cost management to obtain this data with a minimal amount of access, create an IAM policy and role for cost management to use. This configuration  provides access to the stored information and nothing else.

.Procedure

. From the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console, create a new IAM policy for the S3 bucket you configured previously.
.. Select the JSON tab and paste the following content in the JSON policy text box:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
        "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/*"
      ]
    },

    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:HeadBucket",
        "cur:DescribeReportDefinitions"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

[NOTE]
====
* Including the Action _iam:ListAccountAliases_ allows cost management to display the AWS account alias, rather than the account ID.
* (Optional) Including Actions _organization:List*_ and _organizations:Describe*_ allows cost management to obtain the display names of AWS member accounts if you are using consolidated billing rather than the account ID.

.. Provide a name for the policy and complete the creation of the policy. Keep the AWS IAM console open as you will need it for the next step.
. In the {platform} *Sources* wizard, click *Next* to move to the next screen.
. In the AWS IAM console, create a new IAM role:
.. For the type of trusted entity, select *Another AWS account*.
.. Enter _589173575009_ as the Account ID to provide the cost management application with read access to the AWS account cost data.
.. Attach the IAM policy you just configured.
.. Enter a role name (and description if desired) and finish creating the policy.
. In the {platform} *Sources* wizard, click *Next* to move to the next screen.
. In the AWS IAM console under Roles, open the summary screen for the role you just created and copy the Role ARN (a string beginning with _arn:aws:_).
. In the {platform} *Sources* wizard, paste your Role ARN and click *Next*.
. Review the details and click *Finish* to add the AWS account to cost management.

Cost management will begin collecting cost and usage data from your master AWS account and any linked AWS accounts.

The data can take a few days to populate before it shows on the cost management dashboard (https://cloud.redhat.com/cost-management/).


[id="enabling_additional_aws_account_access"]
[[enabling_additional_aws_account_access]]
=== Enabling additional account access for cost and usage consumption

Cost management can display additional data that might be useful. For example:

* Include the Action _iam:ListAccountAliases_ to display an AWS account alias rather than an account number in cost management.
* Include the Actions _organization:List*_ and _organizations:Describe*_
to obtain the display names of AWS member accounts if you are using consolidated billing rather than the account ID.

The following configuration provides access to additional stored information and nothing else.

.Procedure
. From the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console, create a new IAM policy for the S3 bucket you configured previously.
. Select the JSON tab and paste the following content in the JSON policy text box:
+
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:ListAccountAliases",
        "s3:HeadBucket",
        "cur:DescribeReportDefinitions",
        "organizations:List*",
        "organizations:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

The remainder of the configuration steps are the same as in <<enabling_additional_aws_account_access>>.
