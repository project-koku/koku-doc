= Configuring a daily Azure data export schedule

[role="_abstract"]
Create a recurring task to export your cost data on a daily basis automatically to your Azure storage account, where {product-title} will retrieve the data.

[NOTE]
====
Cost management requires a data export from a *Subscription* level scope. You must create the cost data export from *Subscriptions*. For more information about how scopes work in Azure, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-work-scopes[_Understand and work with scopes_] in the Azure documentation.
====

. In the Azure Portal, navigate to *All Services > Cost Management + Billing|Cost Management*
. Under *Settings*, click *Exports*
. At the top of the *Exports* window, ensure the selected scope is a subscription, not a resource group.

    * Verify subscription is now set as the scope for the export

. Click *Add*.

    * Enter any name for the export
    * For *Export type*, select *Daily export of month-to-date costs*.
    * For *Subscription*, select the same subscription as earlier.
    * For *Storage account*, select the account created earlier.
    * Enter any value for the container name and directory path for the export. These values provide the tree structure in the storage account where report files are stored.

. Click *Create*.
. In the *Exports* window, select the newly created export and click *Run now* to start exporting data to the Azure storage container.
. In the {platform-title} *Sources* wizard, click *Next* when you have created the export schedule and review the source details.
. Click *Finish* to complete adding the Azure source to {product-title}.

After the schedule is created, {product-title} will begin polling Azure for cost data, which will appear on the {product-title} dashboard ({link-cost-management}).

See link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/tutorial-export-acm-data[Create and manage exported data] from the Azure documentation for more details.
