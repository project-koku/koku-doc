= Creating an AWS or Azure cost model with a markup

As cloud infrastructure sources collect cost and usage data into cost management with prices already assigned, you only need to assign a markup or discount (if desired) to accurately reflect your costs. These _raw costs_ are collected in cost management from AWS Cost and Usage Reports or Azure exports.

Adding a markup to your _raw costs_ can allow you to account for your overhead costs, such as the cost of administering your AWS account, Azure subscription, or other support costs. A markup is an estimation to cover your costs not shown by metrics or usage.

This example shows how to add a 10% markup to the information collected from the AWS Cost and Usage Reports. The same method can be used to apply a markup to your Azure costs.

.Prerequisites

* A user with Cost Administrator or Cost Price List Administrator permissions. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/cost_management_service/2021/html/getting_started_with_cost_management/assembly_limiting_access_cost_resources_rbac[Limiting access to cost management resources] in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions on configuring user roles.
* Your AWS account added to cost management as a data source. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/cost_management_service/2021/html/getting_started_with_cost_management/adding_an_aws_source[Adding an Amazon Web Services (AWS) source to cost management] in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions.


.Procedure

. From the *Cost models* menu, click *Create cost model* to open the cost model wizard.
. Enter a name and description for the cost model, and select *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* as the source type to apply the cost model to. Click *Next*.
. To apply a 10% markup to the base costs of your resources, enter _10_ in the as the *Markup rate* and click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
====
* To apply a discount rather than a markup, enter a minus sign with the value (for example, _-15_).
* If you do not want to apply a markup or discount, enter _0_.
====
+
. Select one or multiple AWS sources to assign the cost model to and click *Next*. Selecting a source with a cost model already assigned will override its previous cost model. You can also assign sources to your cost model at a later time.
. Review the cost model details, and click *Create*.
. Click *Close* to exit the cost model wizard.

Your new cost model will appear in the list on the *Cost models* page.

.Next steps

* From the *Cost models* summary page, you can review information about your cost models, including:
** The source type the cost model was created for
** The number of sources assigned to the cost model
** The date the cost model was last modified
+
* To see more information or edit a cost model:
+
** From the *Cost models* summary page, click image:more-options.png[] (*more options*), then *View details* or *Delete* the cost model. From the *View details* option, you can edit the cost model, including source assignments, markup, and other settings.

* Review your tags and tagging strategy to ensure that costs are being distributed to the correct resources, cost centers, or teams. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/cost_management_service/2021/html-single/managing_cost_data_using_tagging/index[_Managing cost data using tagging_] for more information.
