= Adding tags to an AWS resource

Amazon creates certain identifiers automatically, like the EC2 instance resource identifier (a number such as `i-123456789`), which cost management uses similarly to a tag.

You can also add your own tags at the individual resource level. These tags must be activated for Cost and Usage Reporting to export them to the cost management application.

Configure AWS tags for cost management using the following steps:

.Procedure

. Create and apply tags to your AWS resources.
+
See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.html[_User-Defined Cost Allocation Tags_] in the AWS documentation for instructions.
+
. Activate the tags you want to be collected by the cost management application via the Cost and Usage Report. In the AWS Billing console, select the tags you want to activate from the Cost Allocation Tags area.
