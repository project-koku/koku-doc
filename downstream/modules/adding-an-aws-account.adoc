== Adding your Amazon account as a source

Using the information from the previous steps, you can now add your AWS account as a source. After adding an AWS source, the cost management application processes the cost and usage data from your AWS account and makes it viewable.

To add your AWS account as a source:

. In cost management, click *Add source* to open the dialog.
. In the dialog, select *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* as the source type.
. Enter a name for the source and click *Next*.
. Paste your S3 bucket name and click *Next*.
. Paste the role ARN and click *Add source*.

Cost management will begin collecting cost and usage data from your AWS account. The data can take a few days to populate before it shows on the cost management dashboard.
