= Replacing a prior operator instance

[role="_abstract"]
If you are replacing a prior {product-title} operator with the {operator-formal}, make certain your existing {product-title} source is properly configured in the YAML configuration file.

IMPORTANT: When you are replacing a prior {product-title} operator with the *{operator-formal}* and you want to use an existing source, you must make certain that the `name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` in the YAML file matches your existing source.


.Prerequisites

* You are logged into the {openshift} web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* You can access {platform-title} and view existing {product-title} sources.


.Procedure

. Under the *Name* heading in the list of installed operators, click the *{operator-formal}* link. The *Installed Operators > Operator Details* window appears for *{operator-formal}*.
. In the *Details* window, click *+{nbsp}Create Instance*.
. A *{operator-formal} > Create {operator-config}* window appears.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button to view and modify the contents of the *{operator-config}* YAML file.
. Open {platform-title} and log in using your Organization Administrator account.
. Click on image:configuration-gear.png[] (Settings).
. Click on the *Sources* tab to display existing sources.
. Select an existing {product-title} source and copy its name.
. In the {operator-config} YAML file, replace `INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` with the source name that you copied from the {product-title} source list for your organization.

    create_source: false
    name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME    <<<< replace this string
----

The `create_source: false` does not change because you are matching an existing source, not creating a new source.
. Click the *Create* button. No further actions are needed to configure the operator instance.
