= Replacing the prior operator instance with the Koku metrics operator

[role="_abstract"]
If you are replacing a prior cost management operator with the Koku metrics operator, make certain your existing cost management source is properly configured in the YAML configuration file.

IMPORTANT: When you are replacing a prior cost management operator with the *Koku Metrics Operator* and you want to use an existing source, you must make certain that the `name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` in the YAML file matches your existing source.


.Prerequisites

* You are logged into the OpenShift Container Platform web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* You can access {platform} and view existing cost management sources.


.Procedure

. Under the *Name* heading in the list of installed operators, click the *KokuMetricsOperator* link. The *Installed Operators > Operator Details* window appears for *Koku Metrics Operator*.
. In the *Details* window, click *+{nbsp}Create Instance*.
. A *Koku Metrics Operator > Create KokuMetricsConfig* window appears.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button to view and modify the contents of the `KokuMetricsConfig.yaml` file.
. Open {platform} and log in using your Organization Administrator account.
. Click on image:configuration-gear.png[] (Settings).
. Click on the *Sources* tab to display existing sources.
. Select an existing cost management source and copy its name.
. In the `KokuMetricsConfig.yaml` file, replace `INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` with the source name that you copied from the cost management source list for your organization.

    create_source: false
    name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME    <<<< replace this string
----

The `create_source: false` does not change because you are matching an existing source, not creating a new source.
. Click the *Create* button. No further actions are needed to configure the operator instance.
