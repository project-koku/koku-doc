Configuring an Azure Active Directory application and service principal provides cost management with the necessary (read-only) access to obtain cost data for Azure resources.

To configure this access, see the Azure guide link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[_How to: Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources_] , and complete the steps in these sections:

. _Create an Azure Active Directory application_
. _Assign the application to a role_
. _Certificates and secrets_

Any additional details or customization for cost management is described below.


. In Azure, create a new Azure Active Directory application.
* Enter a display name of your choice and default values for all other fields.
* Copy the display name to use in the next step.
. In Azure, assign the application to a role at the subscription scope.
* Use the subscription you used to create the storage account.
* Add a new role assignment with the settings:
** Role:   _Storage Blob Data Reader_
** Assign access to:   Azure AD user, group, or service principal
** Select:  <type the application display name from the previous step>
. In Azure, create a new application secret.
* From your applicationâ€™s page, create a new client secret.
* Enter a description and click *Add*.
* Copy the _Value_ for the secret.

[NOTE]
====
Save your secret to a secure location, as you will need the secret value and application ID to sign in as the application. As the secret value cannot be retrieved again later, if you lose the secret, you will need to create a new one and update it where it has been used.
====
. In Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to obtain your Subscription ID:
+
----
$ az account show --query "{subscription_id: id }"
----
+
. In the {platform} *Sources* wizard, enter your *Subscription ID*.
. In Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to obtain your tenant ID, client (application) ID, and client secret:
+
----
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --query '{"tenant": tenant, "client_id": appId, "secret": password}'
----
+
. In the {platform} *Sources* wizard, enter your Azure Active Directory *Tenant ID*, *Client ID*, and *Client Secret*, and click *Next*.
