// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// assembly_cost_limiting_access_rbac.adoc

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: adding_a_role_cost_rbac.adoc
// * ID: [id="adding_a_role_cost_rbac"]
// * Title: = Adding a role

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Adding a role

Create a new role to manage and limit the scope of information that users can see within cost management.

.Prerequisites




* You must be an Account Administrator or a member of a group with the _RBAC Administrator_ role to create a role.

.Procedure

. From cost management, click image:configuration-gear.png[] (*Settings*) to navigate to *User Access*.
. Click the *Roles* tab.
. Click *Create Role* to open the *Add role* wizard.
. In the *Name and Description* screen, enter a name for the new role, and optionally, a description. Click *Next*.
. In the *Permission* screen, specify the Red Hat Cloud Services application you are creating the role for (in this case, cost management) as well as the resource and permission type:
.. For *Application*, enter _cost-management_.
//UI note -- this should be a drop-down for ease of use.
.. For *Resource type*, specify the resource this permission will be used to access from the following list:
+
- _aws.account_
- _azure.subscription_guid_
- _openshift.cluster_
- _openshift.node_
- _openshift.project_
+
.. For *Permission*, specify _read_ as all cost resource data is read-only.
+
For example, to create a role with read-only permissions to AWS account data, set _aws.account_ as the *Resource type* and _read_ as the *Permission*. In the next step, you can specify the AWS account to apply this role to.
+
. In the *Resource definitions* screen, you can provide more details about the resources the permission will be used for. For example, to grant this role access to a specific AWS account, enter the following and click *Add to definitions*:
* *Key*: _aws.account_
** Options for *Key* are: _aws.account_, _azure.subscription_guid_, _openshift.cluster_, _openshift.node_, _openshift.project_
* *Operation*: _equal_
** Use _equal_ if you know the exact value, or _list_ to see a list of values that will work for this role.
* *Value*: Your AWS account number or account alias.
** This is specific to the resource defined in the *Key* field. Examples include the AWS account ID or alias, Azure subscription ID, OpenShift cluster ID, OpenShift node name, or OpenShift project name. 
+
You can also enter *** in this field as a wildcard to create a role that matches everything of the resource type defined in *Key*.
. Add more resource definitions if desired and click *Next* when finished.
. Review the details for this role and click *Confirm* to create the role.

Your new role will be listed in the *Roles* tab on the *User Access Management* screen.

.Next steps

* Add this role to a group to provide the role with access to resources.
