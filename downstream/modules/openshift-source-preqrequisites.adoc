// Module included in the following assemblies:
// -Partially done, decide whether to use
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: openshift_source_preqrequisites.adoc
// * ID: [id="openshift_source_preqrequisites"]
// * Title: = Doing procedure A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="openshift_source_preqrequisites"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Prerequisites for OpenShift sources
// Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

This paragraph is the procedure module introduction: a short description of the procedure.

.Prerequisites

* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this module.
* You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this module.
* Delete the section title and bullets if the module has no prerequisites.

.Procedure

. Start each step with an active verb.

. Include one command or action per step.

. Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the procedure includes only one step.

//.Verification steps
//(Optional) Provide the user with verification method(s) for the procedure, such as expected output or commands that can be used to check for success or failure.

.Additional resources

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the procedure module.
* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.

* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
