To make data available as early as possible, AWS can send a Simple Notification Service (SNS) alert to cost management when writing or updating cost and usage data. 

To enable SNS alerts:

. Create an SNS topic in the same region as your S3 bucket with the following details:
* Topic name: _koku-cost_
* Display name: _koku-cost_
. Edit the SNS topic policy to include a reference to the S3 bucket created previously. 
. In the *Advanced view* tab, change the *Condition* portion of the JSON policy to match the below example, replacing _bucket_name_ with the name of your S3 bucket. To save the policy, click *Update policy*.
+
Before:
+
----
"Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
        "AWS:SourceOwner": "AccountID"
    }
}
----
+
After:
+
----
"Condition": {
  "ArnLike": {
    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:*:*:bucket_name"
  }
}
----
+
. Create a subscription for the SNS topic with the following details:
* Protocol: _HTTPS_
* Endpoint: _https://_
. From the AWS S3 console, configure event notifications for your S3 bucket. Add a notification with a name of your choice and the following values:
* ObjectCreate (All) checkbox: Selected
* Prefix: (leave blank)
* Suffix: (leave blank)
* From *Send to*, enter the name of the SNS topic you just created.
