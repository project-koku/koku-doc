= Applying a markup or discount to cloud sources

[role="_abstract"]
Create a AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud cost model to apply a markup or discount to your cloud infrastructure costs.

As cloud infrastructure sources (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) collect cost and usage data into cost management with prices already assigned, you only need to assign a markup or discount (if desired) to accurately reflect your costs.

Adding a markup to your _raw costs_ can allow you to account for your overhead costs, such as the cost of administering your AWS account, Azure subscription, or other support costs. A markup is an estimation to cover your costs not shown by metrics or usage.

This example shows how to add a 10% markup to the information collected from the AWS Cost and Usage Reports. The same method can be used to apply a markup or discount to your Azure or Google Cloud costs.

[NOTE]
====
Creating, editing, or deleting a cost model only updates calculations starting from the first day of the current month.

.Prerequisites

* A user with Cost Administrator or Cost Price List Administrator permissions. See _{link-limiting-access}_ in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions on configuring user roles.
* Your AWS account added to {product-title} as a data source. See _{link-adding-aws}_ in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions.


.Procedure

. From the *Cost models* menu, click btn:[Create cost model] to open the cost model wizard.
. Enter a name and description for the cost model, and select *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* as the source type to apply the cost model to. Click btn:[Next].
. To apply a 10% markup to the base costs of your resources, enter _10_ in the as the *Markup rate* and click btn:[Next].
+
[NOTE]
====
* To apply a discount rather than a markup, enter a minus sign with the value (for example, _-15_).
* If you do not want to apply a markup or discount, enter _0_.
====
+
. Select one or multiple AWS sources to assign the cost model to and click btn:[Next]. Selecting a source with a cost model already assigned will override its previous cost model. You can also assign sources to your cost model at a later time.
. Review the cost model details, and click btn:[Create].
. Click btn:[Close] to exit the cost model wizard.

Your new cost model will appear in the list on the *Cost models* page.

.Next steps

* From the *Cost models* summary page, you can review information about your cost models, including:
** The source type the cost model was created for
** The number of sources assigned to the cost model
** The date the cost model was last modified
+
* To see more information, assign, or edit a cost model:
+
** From the *Cost models* summary page, click a cost model name to bring up the details page where you can edit the cost model, including source assignments, markup, and other Settings.

** From the *Cost models* summary page, click image:more-options.png[] (*more options*), then *Delete*.
