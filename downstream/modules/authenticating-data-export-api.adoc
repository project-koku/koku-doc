// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: authenticating_data_export_API.adoc
// * ID: [id="authenticating_data_export_API"]
// * Title: = Authenticating to the data export API

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="doing-one-procedure_{context}"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
