== Enabling OpenShift tag grouping

By default, {product-title} groups OpenShift cost data by cluster, node, and project on the *OpenShift details* page. Grouping data by tag key can be useful to further customize your view.

To group your cost data by tag key, you must enable the tag keys in the {platform} application settings.

.Prerequisites

* You must have Organization Administrator privileges to change these settings in {product-title}. See _{link-limiting-access}_ in _Getting started with cost management_ for more information about user roles and access.

.Procedure
//Updated July 20, 2020 to match current Applications tab in Settings

To enable OpenShift tag keys for grouping:

. Click image:configuration-gear.png[] (*Settings*) to navigate to *Applications* > *{product-title}*.
. Click *Enable OpenShift labels*.
. Select the keys you want to group by in the {product-title} application from the *Available Tags* list, and use the arrows to move the tags to the *Enabled Tags* list.
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

.Verification steps

The enabled tag keys will now be available to group costs from the *OpenShift details* area of {product-title}, in the *View by* list. For example, when you choose *View by: Tag*:
