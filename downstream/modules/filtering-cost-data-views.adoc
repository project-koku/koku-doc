// Very basic overview of viewing cost data by tag or label
[role="_abstract"]
Tags allow you to customize your view of cost data. You can view resources by type (for example, project, node, cluster) or tag or label in order to investigate why certain resources show an increase in cost, or when data looks abnormal.

This example shows how to see how much each OpenShift project within a cluster is costing.



.Prerequisites

* Your OpenShift cluster added as a cost management data source. See _{link-adding-ocp}_ in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions.
* Your cloud infrastructure account added as a cost management data source. See _{link-getting-started}_ for instructions for your cloud provider type.
* Configure tags on your sources. For tips and configuration instructions, see xref:assembly-configuring-tags-sources_configuring-tags-and-labels[].

.Procedure

. From the *OpenShift details* menu, click the filter button and select *Tag*.
. In the *Choose key* dropdown list, select the key to filter by. For example, select _environment_ to view clusters with the _environment_ tag. Selecting a tag key reveals another dropdown to choose the value to filter by.
. In the *Choose value* dropdown list, select one or more values to filter by. For example, select _qe_ and _dev_ to show cost data for OpenShift projects with these tags.
. To view more information about each project:
* Click the arrow icon for each resource to see more information such as the cluster(s) the resource belongs to, and CPU and memory usage, limits, and requests.
* Click image:more-options.png[](*more options*) to reveal more viewing options:
** Click *View price lists* to see rates applied to the OpenShift metrics to calculate the costs.
** Click *View historical data* to open the daily usage comparison view, which compares usage, request, and limits by day between months for that resource.
** Click *View all projects* or *View all tags* to see related resources and metadata.
. Click *Clear all filters* to reset your OpenShift details view.
