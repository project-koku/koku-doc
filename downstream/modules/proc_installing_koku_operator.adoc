= Installing the Koku metrics operator
= Configuring the operator instance for a new installation
= Replacing the prior operator instance with the Koku metrics operator
= Removing a prior cost operator
The latter 3 sections should be in individual modules

[id="proc_installing_koku_operator"]
= Installing the Koku metrics operator

Install the Koku operator `koku-metrics-operator` from the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged into the OpenShift Container Platform web console with cluster administrator privileges.

.Procedure

. Login to the OpenShift Container Platform web console and click on the *Operators > OperatorHub* tab.
. Search for and locate *Koku Metrics Operator*.
. Click on the displayed *Koku Metrics Operator* tile.
. If an information panel appears with the Community Operators message, click *Continue*.
. When the *Install Operator* window appears, you must select the *`koku-metrics-operator`* namespace for installation. If the namespace does not yet exist, it is created for you.
. Click on the *Install* button.
. After a short wait, *Koku Metrics Operator* appears in the *Installed Operators* tab under *Project: all projects* or *Project: koku-metrics-operator*.

[id="configuring-the-operator-instance-for-a-new-installation"]
= Configuring the operator instance for a new installation

Use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to configure the `koku-metrics-operator` instance after it is installed.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged into the OpenShift Container Platform web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* The *Koku Metrics Operator* appears in the *Installed Operators* tab.

.Procedure

. Under the *Name* heading in the list of installed operators, click the *KokuMetricsOperator* link. The *Installed Operators > Operator Details* window appears for *Koku Metrics Operator*.
. In the *Details* window, click *+{nbsp}Create Instance*.
. A *Koku Metrics Operator > Create KokuMetricsConfig* window appears.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button to view and modify the contents of the YAML configuration file.
. When you create a new cost management instance for the Koku metrics operator, make the following modifications in the YAML configuration file.
. Locate the following two lines in the YAML file.
+
----
    create_source: false
    name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME
----
+
.. Change `false` to `true`.
.. Change `INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` to the new name of your source.
+
.Example
----
    create_source: true
    name: koku-cost-source
----
. Click the *Create* button. These actions create a new source for cost management that will appear in the {platform} cost management application.

[id="replacing-prior-operator-instance-with-koku"]
= Replacing the prior operator instance with the Koku metrics operator

If you are replacing a prior cost management operator with the Koku metrics operator, make certain your existing cost management source is properly configured in the YAML configuration file.

IMPORTANT: When you are replacing a prior cost management operator with the *Koku Metrics Operator* and you want to use an existing source, you must make certain that the `name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` in the YAML file matches your existing source.


.Prerequisites

* You are logged into the OpenShift Container Platform web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* You can access {platform} and view existing cost management sources.


.Procedure

. Under the *Name* heading in the list of installed operators, click the *KokuMetricsOperator* link. The *Installed Operators > Operator Details* window appears for *Koku Metrics Operator*.
. In the *Details* window, click *+{nbsp}Create Instance*.
. A *Koku Metrics Operator > Create KokuMetricsConfig* window appears.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button to view and modify the contents of the `KokuMetricsConfig.yaml` file.
. Open {platform} and log in using your Organization Administrator account.
. Click on image:configuration-gear.png[] (Settings).
. Click on the *Sources* tab to display existing sources.
. Select an existing cost management source and copy its name.
. In the `KokuMetricsConfig.yaml` file, replace `INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` with the source name that you copied from the cost management source list for your organization.
+
----
    create_source: false
    name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME    <<<< replace this string
----
+
The `create_source: false` does not change because you are matching an existing source, not creating a new source.
. Click the *Create* button. No further actions are needed to configure the operator instance.

[id="removing-a-cost-operator"]
= Removing a prior cost operator

After installing the `koku-metrics-operator`, uninstall the prior `cost-mgmt-operator` operator.

To avoid gaps in your cost management data, you can wait 24 to 48 hours before removing `cost-mgmt-operator` while you verify that `koku-metrics-operator` provides cost management reports.

NOTE: If you mistakenly remove the *Koku Metrics Operator*, reinstall it.

.Prerequisites
* The `cost-mgmt-operator` is installed.
+
NOTE: The `cost-mgmt-operator` is deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 4.5 and later. Beginning with OpenShift Container Platform 4.5 or later, you must install `koku-metrics-operator`.

* You installed the *Koku Metrics Operator*.
* You are logged into the OpenShift Container Platform web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* You can view the operators in the *Installed Operators* tab.

.Procedure
. In the Installed Operators list, select the operator you want to remove.
. Click on the image:more-options.png[] (More options) icon in that row.
. Click on the *Uninstall Operator* option. Confirm the action to remove the operator.
. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click the *Administration > Custom Resource Definitions* tab.
. In the window that displays the custom resource definitions (CRD), locate the *CostManagement* CRD and the *CostManagementData* CRD.
. For each CRD, click on the image:more-options.png[] (More options) icon and click on *Delete Custom Resource Definition*. Confirm the delete action.
. When these CRDs are deleted, the `cost-mgmt-operator` is fully uninstalled.

NOTE: When you install *Koku Metrics Operator*, a *KokuMetricsConfig* CRD appears in  *Administration > Custom Resource Definitions* list.
