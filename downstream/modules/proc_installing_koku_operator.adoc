= Configuring the operator instance for a new installation

.Prerequisites
* You are logged into the OCP web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* The *Koku Metrics Operator* appears in the *Installed Operators* tab.

.Procedure

. Under the *Name* heading in the list of installed operators, click the *KokuMetricsOperator* link. The *Installed Operators > Operator Details* window appears for *Koku Metrics Operator*.
. In the *Details* window, click *+{nbsp}Create Instance*.
. A *Koku Metrics Operator > Create KokuMetricsConfig* window appears.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button to view and modify the contents of the YAML configuration file.
. When you create a new cost management instance for the Koku metrics operator, make the following modifications in the YAML configuration file.
. Locate the following two lines in the YAML file.
+
----
    create_source: false
    name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME
----
+
.. Change `false` to `true`.
.. Change `INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` to the new name of your source.
+
.Example
----
    create_source: true
    name: koku-cost-source
----
. Click the *Create* button. These actions create a new source for cost management that will appear in the https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com] cost management application.

= Configuring the operator instance for an existing installation

If you are *upgrading* an existing installation, make certain your existing cost management source is properly configured in the YAML configuration file.

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to the *Koku Metrics Operator* from a previous cost management operator installation or you want to use an existing source, you must make certain that the `name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` in the YAML file matches your existing source.


.Prerequisites

* You are logged into the OCP web console with cluster administrator privileges.
* You can access https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com] and view existing cost management sources.


.Procedure

. Under the *Name* heading in the list of installed operators, click the *KokuMetricsOperator* link. The *Installed Operators > Operator Details* window appears for *Koku Metrics Operator*.
. In the *Details* window, click *+{nbsp}Create Instance*.
. A *Koku Metrics Operator > Create KokuMetricsConfig* window appears.
. Click the *YAML view* radio button to view and modify the contents of the `KokuMetricsConfig.yaml` file.
. Open https://cloud.redhat.com[cloud.redhat.com] and log in using your Organization Administrator account.
. Click on image:configuration-gear.png[] (Settings).
. Click on the *Sources* tab to display existing sources.
. Select an existing cost management source and copy its name.
. In the `KokuMetricsConfig.yaml` file, replace `INSERT-SOURCE-NAME` with the source name that you copied from the cost management source list for your organization.
+
----
    create_source: false
    name: INSERT-SOURCE-NAME    <<<< replace this string
----
+
The `create_source: false` does not change because you are matching an existing source, not creating a new source.
. Click the *Create* button. No further actions are needed to configure the operator instance.
