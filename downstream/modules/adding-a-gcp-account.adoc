= Adding your Google Cloud account as a source

[role="_abstract"]
Using the information from the previous steps, you can now add your Google Cloud account as a source. After adding a Google Cloud source, the {product-title} application processes the cost and usage data from your Google Cloud account and makes it viewable.

.Prerequisites

* Red Hat account user with Sources Administrator entitlements
* Google Cloud xref:creating-a-project-gcp_{context}[project]
* xref:adding-new-member-with-cost-role-gcp_{context}[Billing service member] with the {product-title} Identity and Access Management (IAM) xref:creating-iam-role-gcp_{context}[role]
* xref:exporting-billing-data-gcp_{context}[Billing export] to xref:creating-a-dataset-gcp_{context}[BigQuery dataset]

.Procedure

. From {platform-title}, click image:configuration-gear.png[] (*Settings*).
. Click btn:[Sources]
. Click btn:[Add source] in the *Cloud sources* tab.
. Enter a name for the source and click btn:[Next]
. In the dialog, select *Google Cloud* as the source type and *{product-title}* as the application.
. Click *Next*.
. Enter your *Project ID* and click *Next*.
. Click btn:[Next] to verify you have created an *Identity and Access Management (IAM) role*.
. Click btn:[Next] to verify you have created a new *billing service account user* and assigned the correct role.
. Enter your *BigQuery Dataset ID* and click btn:[Next]
. Click btn:[Next] to verify you have enabled your *BigQuery billing export*.
. Review the details and click btn:[Add]



.Verification steps
* Verify your source is listed with *_Available_* status in the *Sources* page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Google may take several hours to gather and export billing data to {product-title}. In the meantime, you will receive a *_configuration in progress_* message, and your source status will display as *_Unknown_* in the *Sources* page.

.Troubleshooting
|===
|Issue | Cause | Remediation steps

| Incorrect IAM permissions for project _yourprojectID_.
| The billing service account member does not have the correct role or permissions for {product-title}.
| Make sure the billing service account has the xref:creating-iam-role-gcp_{context}[{product-title} role] with the correct permissions.

| Unable to find dataset: _yourdatasetID_ in project: _yourprojectID_.
| The BigQuery dataset ID was entered incorrectly or does not exist.
| Make sure the xref:creating-a-dataset-gcp_{context}[BigQuery dataset ID] matches the one created for {product-title}.

| Source status _"Unknown"_ longer than 24 hours.
| Cost management cannot find cost data in the BigQuery dataset provided.
| Make sure your xref:exporting-billing-data-gcp_{context}[billing export] is configured and xref:viewing-data-collected-gcp_{context}[billing tables] exist in your BigQuery dataset.
