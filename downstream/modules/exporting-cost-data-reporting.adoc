Tags allow you to customize your view of cost data. This is useful when you want to investigate further why certain resources show an increase in cost, or data looks abnormal.

This example shows how to view data for specific OpenShift resources, and export the data to your desired reporting tool.

.Prerequisites

* Your OpenShift cluster added as a cost management data source. See _{link-adding-ocp}_ in _Getting started with cost management_ for instructions.
* Your cloud infrastructure account added as a cost management data source. See _{link-getting-started}_ for instructions for your cloud provider type.
* Configure tags on your sources. For tips and configuration instructions, see xref:assembly-configuring-tags-sources_configuring-tags-and-labels[].

.Procedure

. From the *OpenShift details* menu, click the filter button and select *Tag*.
. In the *Choose key* dropdown list, select the key to filter by. For example, select _version_. Selecting a tag key reveals another dropdown to choose the value to filter by.
. In the *Choose value* dropdown list, select one or more values to filter by. For example, select _qe_ and _dev_ to show cost data for OpenShift resources with these tags.
//Is that right? How can this be more useful?
. To export data about your resources, check the boxes next to each resource you want to export data for. Click *Export* to open the export options dialog.
. Specify a daily or monthly aggregate and click *Generate and download*.

The CSV file will download to your local system, and you can use it in your desired reporting tool.
