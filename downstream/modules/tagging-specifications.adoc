[id="tagging-specifications_{context}"]
= Tag specifications by source type

[role="_abstract"]
Tagging standards differ between source types. To use the same tags/labels across sources, you must use the most common of all the restrictions across the different providers.

The following table summarizes tagging and labelling criteria across AWS, Azure and OpenShift Container Platform 4:
