= Adding a role to a group

[role="_abstract"]
Once you have decided the correct roles for your organization, you must add your role to a group to manage and limit the scope of information that members in that group can see within {product-title}.

The Member tab shows all users that you can add to the group. When you add users to a group, they become members of that group. A group member inherits the roles of all other groups they belong to.

.Prerequisites

* You must be an Organization Administrator (org admin).
* If you are not an org admin, you must be a member of a group that has the User Access Administrator role assigned to it.

[NOTE]
====
Only the org admin can assign the User Access Administrator role to a group.

.Procedure

. Log in to your Red Hat organization account at {platform-title}.
. Click image:configuration-gear.png[] (*Settings*) to open the Settings page.
. Click the *Groups* tab.
. Click *Create group*.
. Follow the guided actions provided by the wizard to add users and roles.
. To grant additional group access, edit the group and add additional roles.

Your new group will be listed in the *Groups* list on the *User Access* screen.

.Verification 

* To verify your configuration, log out of the {product-title} application and log back in as a user added to the group.

For more information about configuring Red Hat account roles and groups, see _{link-console-rbac}_ in the {platform-title} documentation.
