<h3 id="what-is-a-cost-model_using-cost-models">What is a cost model?</h3>
<div class="paragraph _abstract">
<p>It can be difficult to find out the real cost of cloud-based IT systems. Different sources provide a variety of cost
data and metrics, which can be complicated to calculate together and accurately distribute the costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cost model is a framework used to define the calculations for the costs stored in cost management. Using a cost model, you can associate a price to metrics provided by your
sources to charge for utilization of resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, those costs are related to the raw costs
of the infrastructure, while others will be based on a price list that associates usage to costs. The
data must be normalized before you can add a markup to it to cover your overhead,
and then distribute the charges to your resources and/or end customers. It helps to align costs to utilization: those customers that use a resource more will be charged more.</p>

<p>A cost model is a framework used to define the calculations for the costs stored in cost management, using raw costs and metrics. The cost model is used for budgeting and accounting, and also the visualization and analysis of costs — in cost management, it provides the basis for the cost information that the user will view. Costs generated by a cost model can be recorded, categorized and allocated to specific customers, business units or projects.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="cost-layers">Cost layers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Costs can be created at different layers of the environment. In cost management, all costs can be classified as either infrastructure or supplementary costs (including your costs that are not identified as infrastructure). In your cost model, you can choose to allocate and present your costs as any of those cost layers. As a result, you can customize what cost management shows on each details page.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Cost management collects cost data from several sources:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory</strong> - A list of all resources that are or were running in your source, whether they are presently in use or not. For example, if your OpenShift Container Platform environment contains a node that is not in use, that node still costs <em>$x</em> amount per month. There are several ways of collecting inventory data into cost management: cost management can generate inventory from the AWS Cost and Usage Report, Azure or Google Cloud export, or OpenShift Metering Operator reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong> - A subset of the OpenShift inventory showing usage and consumption for each resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud raw costs</strong> - AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide regular reports to cost management listing consumption of resources and their costs, which cost management uses for calculations. As a result, configuring a custom price list is not necessary for cloud sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>cost model</strong> allows you to apply a markup or discount of your choice to account for other costs and overhead, and provides options for assigning a cost layer (infrastructure or supplementary) to costs:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>For OpenShift Container Platform sources - Since the metrics and inventory data do not have a price assigned to usage, you must create and assign a <strong>price list</strong> to your sources to determine the <strong>usage cost</strong> of these resources. A price list includes rates for storage, memory, CPU usage and requests, and clusters and nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud sources - You can create cost models for these sources to account for any extra costs or overhead in your environment by applying a <strong>markup</strong> percentage, or a negative percentage to calculate a discount.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs from sources are then collected together and allocated as <strong>infrastructure cost</strong> and <strong>supplementary cost</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost is then <strong>distributed</strong> to resources across the environment. Depending on your organization, these resources may include OpenShift projects, nodes, or clusters, and cloud source services or accounts. You can also use tagging to distribute the costs by team, project, or group within your organization.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As cloud infrastructure sources (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) collect cost and usage data into cost management with prices already assigned, you only need to assign a markup or discount (if desired) to accurately reflect your costs.</p>

<p>Adding a markup to your <em>raw costs</em> can allow you to account for your overhead costs, such as the cost of administering your AWS account, Azure subscription, or other support costs. A markup is an estimation to cover your costs not shown by metrics or usage.</p>

<p>Creating a cost model for an OpenShift source includes assigning prices for usage and requests using <strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>memory</strong>, <strong>node</strong>, <strong>cluster</strong>, <strong>storage</strong>, or <strong>persistent volume claim</strong> metrics, and applying a markup or discount to determine the total costs of your OpenShift infrastructure. You can also use tags to measure costs for specific parts of your infrastructure, such as various storage methods, giving you greater control over your individual requirements.
