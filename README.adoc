== Modular documentation structure

The following is a map of this repository:

....
.
|
├── community
├── downstream
│   ├── attributes
|   ├── assemblies
│   │   ├── assembly-title-1.adoc
│   │   ├── assembly-title-2.adoc
│   │   └── modules -> ../modules/
│   ├── images

│   ├── modules
│   │   ├── module-title-1.adoc

└── README.adoc
....

Top-level directories are:

* community: A directory for upstream-specific assemblies and titles.
* downstream: A directory that stores modules, assemblies, and titles relevant to both downstream and upstream. 

Lower-level directories are:

* attributes: A common directory for attribute files. 
* assemblies: A directory for all assemblies, each on in its own AsciiDoc tile. Assemblies are collections of modules linked together. 
* images: A directory for all images and other digital content.
* modules: A directory for all modules, each one in its own AsciiDoc file.
* titles: A directory for titles, which are collections of assemblies linked together.

=== Modules

Modules are categorized by content type and written using templates.

Modules can be procedure, concept, or reference topics. The module type is labelled in each file name:

* Procedure: `TOPIC.adoc`
* Concept: `con_TOPIC.adoc`
* Reference: `ref_TOPIC.adoc`

Templates are available in this repository's _modules_ directory to copy and write from.

See the _Modular Documentation Reference Guide_ for information about these file types: https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/.


=== Conventions

Images::
* The _Images_ directory contains any screenshots, saved in .png format. Use screenshots minimally and only if necessary, as they require more maintenance than text edits do in a rapidly-developing product, and additional localization work. Text documentation allows for greater accessibility for all users, and can be used with screen reading software.
* UI icons, if needed, should be approximately 21px x 21px in size and saved in the _Images_ directory.
